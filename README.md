# File Cloud Lab

Backend-driven SaaS platform for file storage and management, built using an API-first approach with a focus on production-grade architecture.

## Live Demo

- API (Swagger):
  https://nest-docker-test-5t7h.onrender.com/docs

- Web (partial client):
  https://full-stack-web-hni7.onrender.com/

The frontend is partially implemented and demonstrates core integration flows:
- initial page
- authentication flow

The project follows a backend-first approach, 
and the frontend is treated as a separate client layer.

## TL;DR

- API-first backend platform designed as a production-style SaaS system
- Covers auth, permissions, file lifecycle, payments, async jobs, and realtime updates
- Integrates PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, S3-compatible storage, and Stripe
- Implements background processing via BullMQ and event-driven architecture
- Demonstrates system design, scalability, and backend engineering practices

## Tech Stack (quick view)
Core technologies used in the system:

Backend:
- NestJS
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL

Infrastructure:
- Redis
- MongoDB
- MinIO (S3-compatible)

Async & Realtime:
- BullMQ
- WebSocket

## Project Scope

This project is focused on backend architecture and system design.

It follows a backend-first approach, where the API is treated as a standalone platform, 
and the frontend is considered an independent client layer.

The frontend is partially implemented to demonstrate integration, 
while the main goal of the project is to design and build a production-style backend system.

The system is designed to support multiple clients, including web, admin, and potential future integrations.

## Architecture

### High-level

The system is structured as a backend-driven platform with a clear separation between API, client, and infrastructure layers.

- API handles business logic, data access, async processing, and integrations
- Client acts as a thin layer responsible for user interaction and API consumption
- Infrastructure services (DB, cache, storage, queue) are externalized

High-level flow:

Client → API → Services → Database  
             ↓  
           Redis / Queue  
             ↓  
          Workers / Jobs  
             ↓  
        External services (S3, Stripe)

---

### Modules

The backend is organized into modular domains:

- auth: authentication, sessions, JWT, OAuth, guards
- users: user management and access control
- files: file lifecycle, upload flow, metadata handling
- payments: Stripe integration and subscription handling
- jobs: background processing and queues (BullMQ)
- events: domain events and decoupled communication
- realtime: WebSocket and SSE delivery
- audit: request and event logging (MongoDB)
- health: liveness and readiness checks
- infrastructure: storage abstraction (S3-compatible)

---

### Architecture Style

- Layered modular architecture (NestJS modules)
- Clear separation between domain logic and infrastructure
- API-first design with client-agnostic backend
- Monorepo setup with isolated applications (api / web)

---

### Key Patterns

- Dependency Injection via NestJS providers
- Event-driven architecture using domain events
- Guard-based authorization (auth + RBAC)
- Storage abstraction for S3-compatible providers
- Async processing via queue-based workers (BullMQ)

---

### System Overview

The system consists of several core subsystems:

- authentication and identity
- access control (RBAC)
- file storage (S3-compatible)
- async processing (queues and jobs)
- realtime delivery (WebSocket, SSE)
- billing (Stripe)
- observability (logging, audit, health)

## User Flow

### Main Flow

1. User opens the application.
2. User signs up or logs in.
3. Client initializes auth state using refresh + `me` request.
4. Authenticated user requests a presigned upload URL.
5. Client uploads file directly to S3-compatible storage.
6. Client confirms upload with the API.
7. File metadata is stored and becomes available in the system.
8. User can view, download, or delete files.
9. Background jobs process files if needed.
10. Realtime updates are delivered via WebSocket or SSE.

---

### Admin / Extended Flow

1. Admin accesses protected endpoints.
2. System validates permissions via RBAC guards.
3. Admin retrieves user data via REST or GraphQL.
4. Events are emitted and processed asynchronously.
5. System streams updates via SSE or WebSocket.

## API

### Swagger

https://nest-docker-test-5t7h.onrender.com/docs

### Postman Collection

https://www.postman.com/artem3-2305/workspace/file-cloud-lab-api

Includes pre-configured requests for authentication, file upload flow, and core API endpoints.

---

### API Structure

The API is organized into domain-based modules with clear separation of concerns:

- auth
- users
- files
- payments
- admin (GraphQL)
- realtime
- health

---

### Core Endpoints

Auth:
- POST /auth/signup
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/refresh
- POST /auth/logout
- GET /auth/me

Users:
- GET /users
- GET /users/:id
- DELETE /users/:id

Files:
- POST /files/presign
- POST /files/confirm
- GET /files
- GET /files/:id/download
- DELETE /files/:id

Payments:
- POST /payments/checkout
- POST /payments/webhook

Health:
- GET /health

---

### Upload Flow

1. Client requests a presigned upload URL from the API.
2. File is uploaded directly to S3-compatible storage.
3. Client confirms upload with the API.
4. File metadata is stored and becomes available for access.

---

### Auth Flow

1. User logs in or signs up.
2. API returns access token and sets session cookies.
3. Access token is used for authenticated requests.
4. On 401 response, client triggers refresh flow.
5. Refresh token rotation is handled via HttpOnly cookies.
6. Request is retried with a new access token.

---

### Admin (GraphQL)

- Endpoint: /graphql
- Used for admin-level queries and aggregated data access
- Protected via RBAC

---

### Realtime

- WebSocket gateway for realtime updates
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming data
- Integrated with domain events

---

### Notes

- Full endpoint list is available in Swagger
- API is designed to be client-agnostic and supports multiple consumers

- Session handling via HttpOnly cookies
- RBAC with route-level guards
- DTO validation with whitelist mode
- Global exception handling
- Rate limiting for auth and public endpoints
- Proper CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests

---

### Performance

- Direct-to-storage upload flow (bypasses API for file transfer)
- Background processing via BullMQ (async jobs)
- Redis used for caching and session handling
- Pagination implemented for users and files

---

### Scalability

- Stateless API with externalized session storage (Redis)
- File storage offloaded to S3-compatible services
- Queue-based architecture allows independent scaling of workers
- Modular architecture supports horizontal scaling

---

### Observability

- Structured logging with Pino
- Audit logging stored in MongoDB
- Health checks (liveness/readiness)
- Structured logs with correlation IDs for request tracing

---

### Trade-offs & Known Issues

- Logout flow requires consistent cookie path configuration
- OAuth flow currently uses query-based token transfer (can be improved)
- Frontend build depends on external Google Fonts

## Roadmap

### Short-term Improvements

- Fix logout cookie cleanup (align cookie path configuration)
- Replace OAuth query-token flow with secure token exchange
- Improve frontend build stability (self-host fonts / local fallback)
- Expand E2E coverage for auth, files, and RBAC

---

### Mid-term Enhancements

- Improve admin panel UX and workflows
- Extend billing features (plans, usage-based logic)
- Add file processing capabilities (thumbnails, metadata extraction)
- Enhance observability (metrics, monitoring integration)

---

### Long-term Direction

- Introduce microservices or service decomposition
- Add multi-tenant support
- Implement advanced permission models (scopes / policies)
- Support multiple client applications (mobile, external integrations)
